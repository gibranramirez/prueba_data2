[CSV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) is a ubiquitous importing and exporting format for tables of information conforming to row-column layout. Lines correspond to rows. On each line, commas separate values under each column; hence Comma-Separated Values. Values between commas define table-cell contents, strings or numbers. The format is relatively flexible, relatively easy for machines and even humans to read and write.
